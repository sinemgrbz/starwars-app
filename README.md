# Star Wars App

This project is a Starship Detail application built using React. It fetches and displays detailed information about different starships from the Star Wars universe using the SWAPI (Star Wars API). The app allows users to view specific starship details based on the starship ID from the URL.

## Features

- **View Starship Details:** Users can view the details of a specific starship such as its model, manufacturer, crew, passengers, and more.
- **Navigate Back to Starships List:** Users can easily navigate back to the list of starships with a simple button click.
- **Error Handling:** Proper error messages are displayed if the starship details cannot be fetched, such as when the starship ID is invalid.
- **Persistent Image:** An image is displayed for each starship, showing a representation of the starship.

## Tools and Technologies

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing application state.

- **CSS**: For styling and layout of the application.
- **SWAPI (Star Wars API)**: For fetching data related to starships from the Star Wars universe.
